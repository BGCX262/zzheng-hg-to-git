  <div class="section">
    <p>
      Java is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_retriever">golden retriever</a>
      named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">one of
      my favorite programming language</a>. He was born on July 7 2006, and has been living with
      <a href="{% url zheng.home %}">me</a> since October 2 2006. He loves to sleep on my feet,
      play with his toys, go out for walks, and chase whatever you throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe Java understands my language, although he never speaks. It's good to have a friend
      who is always willing to listen.
